## Assignment Requirements  
Create a Github repo with a well-written ReadMe file; add your partner as a collaborator.
You will be building a 1-page app about Video Games. Each of you will pick a unique video
game.
Update the readme with a brief description of what you’re building; edit the rest as you see
fit.
Use the provided build as your starting point; use branches, commits and pull requests to
complete the requirements as described below.
Update the sprite (provided) with video game images (four at minimum) and provide an
animation (transition or keyframe animation) on hover. Change the layout of that part of the
page to fit - update the CSS as it’s currently designed for the Marvel build.
Do something different with that part of the layout.
When clicked, the selected image should show some kind of visual update using the ::after
and :checked pseudo classes.
A lightbox should open with more information about the selected video game and its plot.
Make sure you merge everything to the main branch and submit the link.

## My Progress:
I built a 1 page app about video games. I chose Hellish Quart, Kenshi, Escape From Tarkov, and Vampire: The Masquerade Bloodlines
I used the provided build as a starting point, and (will) follow the fundamentals of proper github use.
I created a sprite image of my video games, using the same dimensions of 150 by 150 pixels
I provided a keyframe animation on hover by black & whiting the image
I added a different background image to add my personal touch

I TRIED to set up a checkbox input and hide it within the sprite image so I could use that to check for changes - but I was unable to. 
I left the attempt there in case it gives me partial marks because I know I'm really really close. I just could not figure it out by the deadline.

I also filled the lightboxes with a general description of the game.
