            <p class="lb_text">
                Hellish Quart is a sword fighting video game by Polish developer Kubold. The game is a 1v1 battle of two sword wielding players who fight until the opposing player is severely injured.

            <p class="lb_text">
                At this moment, there is no story to the game yet, and Hellish Quart simply acts as a vehicle for a highly skilled video game Animator + HEMA enthusiast to create a love letter for European swordfighting. All techniques and weapons are based on historical weaponry and manuals.

            <p class="lb_text">
                A free-roaming squad based RPG. Focusing on open-ended sandbox gameplay features rather than a linear story. Be a trader, a thief, a rebel, a warlord, an adventurer, a farmer, a slave, or just food for the cannibals.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                This game has a linear story, although very obscured through a lack of telling. For the player to want to learn the "story", they have to explore a vast world and find it out themselves. It is a "create your own story" style game which does a great job in environmental storytelling, with the biomes of the game telling a small story of the greater world which the player can unfold piece by piece.

            <h3 class="lb_heading">Escape From Tarkov</h3>
            <p class="lb_text">
                Escape from Tarkov is a multiplayer tactical first-person shooter video game in development by Battlestate Games for Windows. The game is set in the fictional Norvinsk region, where a war is taking place between two private military companies.
            </p>
            <p class="lb_text">
                It tells a story of the bleak near-future where mega corporations are given too much power while nations are constantly barred by red tape, with the inevitable outcome leading to nuclear fallout. The story explores the worst case scenario of the modern military direction towards privatized security. In-game, players bring gear into a raid and must survive and extract in order to keep the gear and any other loot they picked up. It gave birth to the term "extraction shooter", and is considered more hardcore due to the high-stakes style of gameplay.
